                <h4>Automated and remote equipment management and monitoring</h4>
                <p>The main IoT applications is related to the automated management of equipment, allowing a centralized system to control and monitor all company processes.

                    This ability to remotely control equipment via digital machines and software also implies that it is possible to control several plants located at different geographic locations.
                    
                    This gives companies an unprecedented ability to oversee advances in their production in real time, while also being able to analyze historical data that they obtain in relation to their processes.
                </p>
                <h4>Quality control</h4>
                <p>Ability to monitor the quality of manufactured products at any stage: from the raw materials that are used in the process, to the way in which they are transported (via smart tracking applications), to the reactions of the end customer once the product is received. This information is vital when studying the efficiency of the company and applying the necessary changes in case failures are detected, with the purpose of optimizing the processes and promptly detect issues in the production chain. It has also been proven that it is essential to prevent risks in more delicate industries, such as pharmaceutics or food.-</p>
                <h4>Supply chain optimization</h4>
                <p>The Industrial IoT applications aimed at achieving a higher efficiency, we can find the ability to have real time in-transit information regarding the status of a company’s supply chain. This allows for the detection of various hidden opportunities for improvement or pinpointing the issues that are hindering processes, making them inefficient or unprofitable.</p>
                <h4>Plant safety improvement</h4>
                <p>Machines that are part of IoT can generate real-time data regarding the situation on the plant. Through the monitoring of equipment damages, plant air quality and the frequency of illnesses in a company, among other indicators, it is possible to avoid hazardous scenarios that imply a threat to the workers. This not only boosts safety in the facility, but also productivity and employee motivation. In addition, economic and reputation costs that result from poor management of company safety are minimized</p>
